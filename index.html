      <span id="kiwi-span-two">The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of somthing small, brown, fuzzy, and found
        in the produce
        section </span>of your local supermarket. But the kiwi is not a fruit-that's kiwifruit, which is native to
      eastern Asia! About the size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird found only in
      New Zealand

          HABITAT AND DIET

        <div class="sub-para">
          <p>
            kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend to be
            very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and
            trees found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up into trees to nest, rest, or escape from
            danger,
            the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs
            multiple
            burrows within its territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest burrows, dug early in the season, become
            overgrown
            at the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the female is ready to lay her eggs.

          FAMILY LIFE
        </div>

        <div class="sub-para">

          <p>
            Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other and their chicks, and males purr during mating.
            Pairs
            do
            fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she is not in the mood for his company. If another
            kiwi
            invades a pair's territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis have been known to fight to the death,
            although
            this
            is rare.
          </p>

          <p>
            An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a female may choose a new male if a mare
            desirable
            one
            wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows
            one
            around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested, the female might wander off or try to scare him
            away.
            Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows dug
            by
            the
            male.
          </p>

          <p>
            The female kiwi lays up to six egges every year. Kiwi eggs are smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in
            color. Htey are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg might reach up to 20 precent of her weight;
            that
            would be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms) baby!
            Compared
            to
            the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14
            kilograms)
            rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6 kilograms).
